# Project React

## Description & Functionality
This project is a responsive React application that helps users choose appropriate clothing based on the current weather. The app fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays the current temperature along with a dynamic weather background. Based on the weather type, the app recommends clothing items that match the conditions.

Users can:
View the current temperature and weather condition
See weather-appropriate clothing recommendations
Add new garments using a modal form
Preview clothing items in a separate modal
Interact with a clean, component-based UI built with React
The application uses reusable components, controlled modals, and state management in the root component to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies
- React (functional components, JSX)
- Vite (development server and build tool)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
